# Lab report 1

### 1. Describe the structure of the document. How is the list of news articles structured with HTML?:

The structure of the document follows a very simple and logical pattern. first we start with a header that contains the title of the page for the browser to show in the page tab. then we have the body of the page, that contains the content of the webpage, including all the news articles.

the articles are structured in such a way that the first one that appears in the HTML will be the first that will appear in the webpage. Each article in the html is represented by a tag containing several other tags, each one modifying a certain parameter or providing text/hyperlinks for the article to show.

### 2. Briefly describe what you see in the hn.js and news.css files. How are these files different? What is their purpose?:

The .js file contains an array of different functions for the webpage. For example, there is a function for voting for the news article, a function for expanding the articles, etc. basically, the .js file contains the logics of the webpage.

The new.css file has all the information about the structure and formatting of the webpage, like colour of the different parts, positioning in the webpage, font of the text, etc. basically, the .css file contains the formatting of the webpage.
